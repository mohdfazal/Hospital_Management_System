* What is @SpringBootApplication?
  @SpringBootApplication is an annotation that combines three important Spring annotations to simplify
  the configuration of a Spring Boot application. It is used to mark the main class that starts a Spring Boot application.

* Here's an easy breakdown:
    @SpringBootApplication is a shortcut for three annotations:

    @SpringBootConfiguration: This tells Spring that the class provides configuration for the application.

    @EnableAutoConfiguration: This tells Spring Boot to automatically configure your application based on
    the dependencies you have (like configuring a web server if you have web-related libraries).

    @ComponentScan: This tells Spring to scan the package where the application is located and all its sub-packages
    to find and register beans (components, services, etc.).

In Simple Terms:

    @SpringBootApplication is like a switch that starts your Spring Boot application, configures it automatically,
    and finds all the necessary components needed to run the app.

*Example:

java

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);  // Starts the application
    }
}

In this example:

@SpringBootApplication is placed on the main class, which Spring Boot uses to launch the app.
You don't need to manually configure things like web servers or database connections—Spring Boot does it for you!
Why is it useful?
It makes setting up a Spring application much easier because you don't have to configure everything manually. It’s perfect for quickly getting a Spring application up and running.
